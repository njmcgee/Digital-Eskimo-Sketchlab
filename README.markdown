Sketchlab is a [Processing](http://processing.org) sketch developed by Ozan Onay and Nathan McGinness at Digital Eskimo. 

It was run as installation at [Web Directions South 2010](http://digitaleskimo.net/blog/2010/10/20/taking-sketch-notes-online-at-web-directions). The installation used two Wii remotes, [Wiimote Whiteboard](http://www.uweschmidt.org/wiimote-whiteboard), and custom infra-red pen and a [custom built table](http://digitaleskimo.net/blog/2010/08/26/the-urban-sketch-lab).
